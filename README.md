# wikipediaPageViews

This is just a few hours effort to put together an application which can be used to trend Arctiles hourly. 
Just recently when I coded it over the weekend Avenger infinity was consistently showing up in top results and soon enough
I saw the news on sunday afternoon that movie broke all records. 

Wikipedia is certainly awesome source for data if you want to play aroud in Analytics space :)

All you need to run this project in the main README. Enjoy!!!
